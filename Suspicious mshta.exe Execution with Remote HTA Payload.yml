status: experimental
description: Detects usage of mshta.exe to load a remote HTA file, a common technique used by attackers to execute payloads such as Metasploit stagers.

detection:
  selection:
    Image|endswith: '\mshta.exe'  # Looks for processes using mshta.exe, which is commonly abused by attackers to run HTA payloads.
    CommandLine|contains:
      - 'http'  # Detects if the command line contains 'http', indicating that the HTA file is being loaded from a remote server.
      - '.hta'  # Ensures the command line contains '.hta', meaning itâ€™s an HTA file, which can be used to execute malicious payloads.
  condition: selection  # The detection condition is met when both of the above criteria are true.
falsepositives:
  - Legitimate internal HTA tools (rare)  # Acknowledge that legitimate internal tools may also use mshta.exe with HTA files, though this is rare.
level: high  # Set the alert level to high because executing remote HTA payloads is a serious threat and often part of a multi-step attack.
