    Image|endswith: '\powershell.exe'  # Looks for processes using PowerShell (powershell.exe) to execute commands.
    CommandLine|contains:
      - 'VirtualAlloc'  # Detects use of VirtualAlloc, a Windows API function used to allocate memory in the process.
      - 'VirtualProtect'  # Detects use of VirtualProtect, another Windows API function used to change memory protection, typically to allow execution of shellcode.
      - 'CreateThread'  # Detects use of CreateThread, used to create a new thread in the process, often to execute shellcode.
      - 'PAGE_EXECUTE'  # Looks for the PAGE_EXECUTE flag, which is typically used to mark memory as executable for shellcode injection.
  condition: memory_injection  # The detection condition is satisfied when any of the above memory injection techniques are used in PowerShell.
falsepositives:
  - Very rare in legit usage (mostly red team / malware)  # Acknowledge that these functions are rarely used in legitimate scenarios, mostly in red team exercises or malware attacks.
level: critical  # Set the alert level to critical because memory injection techniques are a high-risk sign of malicious activity and can lead to full control of the system.
